    "Prompting": "At the \"Prompting\" level, I can usually do many tasks on my own but sometimes need a gentle reminder to get started. I can plan and work towards completing everyday activities like getting dressed, eating, or having a conversation, but I may need help if a problem comes up. I can follow simple instructions and find things in obvious places, but I might struggle with longer directions or searching beyond where I normally look. I do best when things are clear and straightforward, but I can have trouble understanding when something feels unclear or hard to follow.",
    "Some Support": "At the \"some support\" level, I can usually manage tasks like bathing, dressing, and making a snack, especially if I follow my usual routines and am in a familiar environment. I enjoy the process of doing these activities more than focusing on the end result, and I can complete them when they are broken down into smaller, 2-3 step instructions. However, I might not always recognize when the activity is necessary or when itâ€™s finished. I rely on visual cues like labels and familiar items being out in the open. I can join in conversations and use simple language, but I may struggle to find the right words or keep up with fast-paced or complex conversations. I do best with topics that are concrete and in the present moment, rather than abstract ideas.",
    "Step-by-Step Guidance": "At the \"Step-by-Step Guidance\" level, I respond primarily to sensations like textures, smells, and colours and require guidance to complete tasks. I can follow instructions if they are broken down into clear, simple steps and provided one at a time. I may not have a conscious plan to finish a task on my own, so I rely on step-by-step directions and gentle reminders. Placing items directly in my hands and using short, straightforward phrases or demonstrations help me stay focused and engaged in activities.",
